            <p>Neev is a biotechnology start-up with the mission of building a fully integrated Biotech
                ecosystem. We start with next-generation diagnostics and treatments for the diseases that cause
                the most deaths, such as antimicrobial resistance and cancer. But we won't stop there. Over time, we
                will expand into every area of health that biology can improve: prevention, treatment, recovery, and
                long-term wellness.</p>
            <p>This is about creating an integrated platform where each part strengthens the others. Diagnostics will
                inform treatment decisions. Treatment data will improve diagnostics. What we learn from cancer will help
                us address AMR. Affordability and accessibility will be part of our foundation, not added later.</p>

            <h2>Why We Exist?</h2>
            <p>Modern medicine has made great strides. We can sequence genomes, edit genes, and image tumors at the
                cellular level. However, this progress hasn't reached everyone. A Patient in Odisha faces the same
                drug-resistant infections as one in Boston, but has fewer treatment options. A patient in rural Africa
                with early-stage cancer has the same biology as one in London, but will only get diagnosed when it's too
                late.</p>
            <p>The tools and science are available. What is lacking is the commitment to create solutions that work in
                the real world: solutions that are effective, affordable, and accessible. Neev.Bio exists to develop
                those solutions.</p>

        <section class="fade-in">
            <h2>Initial Targets</h2>
            <p>Our first targets are antimicrobial resistance and cancer, which cause over 11 million deaths each year.
                These issues represent urgent human problems where the gap between what is possible and what is
                available is unacceptable.</p>
            <p>We work through the entire development process, from identifying biological targets to designing
                molecules or diagnostic tools. We validate our solutions in the lab and clinic and determine how to
                manufacture them at a cost that is affordable for most of the world.</p>
