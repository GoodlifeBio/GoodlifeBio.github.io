            <p>Modern medicine has made great strides. We can sequence genomes, edit genes, and image tumors at the
                cellular level. However, this progress hasn't reached everyone. A Patient in Odisha faces the same
                drug-resistant infections as one in Boston, but has fewer treatment options. A patient in rural Africa
                with early-stage cancer has the same biology as one in London, but will only get diagnosed when it's too
                late. According to the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/diagnostics" target="_blank"
                    style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;"><em>Lancet Commission on Diagnostics</em></a>,
                nearly about half the global
                population over 3 billion people has little to or lacks access to basic, essential testing. High-income
                nations account for nearly 80% of global pharmaceutical spending, yet represent just 15% of the
                population. We are innovating at the absolute frontier of science, but the foundation beneath it is
                entirely broken.</p>

            <p>A discovery that stays in a lab helps no one. A treatment that costs more than a house helps almost no
                one. People are dying from treatable diseases because the needed treatments are not yet available or
                accessible (most of the time). Every day/month/year we wait costs lives.</p>

            <p>Imagine a world where cutting-edge diagnostics and life-saving therapies are available to everyone,
                irrespective of their income strata with clinical-grade accuracy. When we finally make these tools and
                tech accessible to all, we won't just be treating patients we'll be shifting our entire culture. Living
                a long, vibrant, disease-free life will become the new normal, not the exception.</p>

            <p>That is why we built <strong>Neev</strong>.</p>

            <p>In Sanskrit, <em>Neev</em> means "foundation" and that is exactly what we are here to rebuild. Our goal
                is to rebuild the foundation of global health from the ground up, empowering a growing movement of
                people who are finally demanding better, fairer healthcare. We want to give humanity the tools and tech
                to break free from the slow, expensive, and frightening wait for medical answers and treatments. We are
                doing this by developing next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics that is <strong>faster, smarter,
                    and more cost-effective</strong> so we can diagnose, fight, and cure diseases before it's too
                late.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: 500; margin-top: 2rem;">Because Health is not a luxury. It is a fundamental human
                right.</p>
