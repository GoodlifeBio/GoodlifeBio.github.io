            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>A discovery that stays in a lab helps no one. A treatment that costs more than a house helps almost no
                one. We design with clinical and manufacturing realities in mind from day one.</p>
            <p>We move with urgency. People are dying from treatable diseases because the needed treatments are not yet
                available or accessible (most of the time). Every day/month/year we wait costs lives.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Work?</h2>
            <p>We operate with small, focused teams who care more about impact than titles. We validate early and often,
                discontinuing programs that don't work and investing more in those that do.</p>
            <p>We partner with academic researchers, clinicians, and public health experts, institutes who understand
                these diseases both in the clinic and in the field. We listen to them because they know what patients
                really need.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Drives Us?</h2>
            <p>Everyone on this team has witnessed what happens when medicine fails. They have seen infections persist
                despite every antibiotic available. They have seen cancers diagnosed at Stage 4 that could have been
                detected at Stage 1. They have seen patients in one country receive treatments that others in different
                countries never get.</p>
            <p>We are building Goodlife.Bio because these failures are unacceptable, and we believe we can do something
                about them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>We're starting with diagnostics and therapeutics because they are the foundation. You need to detect
                disease and treat it. However, health involves more than that.</p>
            <p>Over time, Goodlife.Bio will expand into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prevention platforms:</strong> Screening tools, biomarker monitoring, and risk prediction
                    models that catch disease before symptoms show.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment optimization:</strong> Precision medicine approaches that match patients to the
                    right therapy based on their biology, rather than trial and error.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery and rehabilitation:</strong> Technologies that help patients regain function after
                    treatment, minimize side effects, and allow them to return to work faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Longitudinal monitoring:</strong> Systems that track patients over years, identifying
                    recurrences early and adjusting treatment as biology changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Access infrastructure:</strong> Manufacturing partnerships, regulatory pathways, and
                    distribution networks that make our solutions available in Bhubaneswar and Boston, in rural clinics
                    and urban hospitals.</li>
                <li><strong>Data integration:</strong> Connecting diagnostics, treatment outcomes, and patient
                    monitoring to continuously improve what we build with the integration of AI and ML.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each component supports the others. Diagnostic data enhances treatment selection. Treatment outcomes
                refine diagnostic algorithms. What we learn from one disease shapes how we handle the next.</p>
            <p>This is the ecosystem. This is how you provide real health, a good life.</p>
